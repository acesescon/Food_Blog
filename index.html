                        <h2>Sisig</h2>
                        <p>
                            Sisig is a world-renowned Filipino dish celebrated for its bold flavors and unique preparation. Traditionally 
                            originating from Pampanga, often hailed as the culinary capital of the Philippines, sisig is made from 
                            chopped pork parts—typically the pig’s head and liver—seasoned with calamansi (Filipino lime), onions, and 
                            chili peppers. The dish is usually served sizzling on a hot plate, creating an irresistible aroma and a delightful 
                            contrast of crispy and tender textures. Its combination of tangy, savory, and slightly spicy flavors has made it 
                            a staple in Filipino cuisine.<br><br>

                            Beyond its taste, sisig has become a cultural symbol of Filipino creativity and resourcefulness. What was once 
                            considered leftover cuts has been transformed into a beloved delicacy enjoyed both as a main dish and a 
                            popular pulutan (beer companion). Today, sisig comes in many variations, including chicken, fish, and even 
                            tofu for healthier alternatives, without losing its signature zest. Whether served at home, in local eateries, or 
                            gourmet restaurants, sisig continues to represent the rich culinary heritage and innovation of the Philippines.

                    <h2>Balut</h2>
                    <p>
                        Balut is a traditional Filipino delicacy that has become one of the most iconic street foods in the Philippines. 
                        It is a fertilized duck egg that has been incubated for about 14 to 21 days, then boiled and eaten straight 
                        from the shell. The dish combines the partially developed duck embryo with the rich, flavorful broth inside 
                        the egg, creating a unique culinary experience. Often enjoyed with a pinch of salt, vinegar, or chili, balut is 
                        commonly sold by street vendors and is considered both a snack and a source of energy.<br><br>

                        Beyond its taste, balut holds deep cultural significance as a symbol of Filipino heritage and culinary daring. It 
                        is often regarded as a food that tests bravery for first-time eaters, yet for locals, it’s a nostalgic comfort food 
                        tied to social gatherings and late-night conversations. While balut may spark curiosity and debate among 
                        foreigners, it remains a cherished delicacy in Filipino culture, showcasing the country’s resourcefulness and 
                        love for bold, flavorful dishes.

                    <h2>Turon</h2>
                    <p>
                        Turon is a popular Filipino snack or dessert made from thin slices of ripe banana, often combined with 
                        jackfruit, wrapped in a spring roll wrapper, and fried until golden and crispy. Before frying, the wrapper is 
                        usually coated with brown sugar, which caramelizes during cooking, giving turon its signature sweet crunch. 
                        This delightful treat is commonly sold by street vendors across the Philippines, making it one of the most 
                        accessible and beloved Filipino snacks.<br><br>

                        More than just a simple dessert, turon reflects the Filipino love for sweet, comforting flavors and creative use 
                        of local ingredients. It is often enjoyed as an afternoon merienda (snack) and pairs perfectly with a hot cup of 
                        coffee or tea. While traditionally made with bananas and jackfruit, variations have emerged over time, 
                        incorporating ingredients like sweet potato, mango, or even ube. Whether served at home or sold on the 
                        streets, turon continues to be a staple in Filipino culinary culture, offering a taste of warmth and nostalgia in 
                        every bite.
